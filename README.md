GIPHY API

I created this using HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, and GIPHY API.

The topic I chose was Comedy Television

When the page opens the default buttons are: The Office, Parks and Rec, Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia, and Impractical Jokers

User then can submit their own search, and it dynamically creates a button in the HTML code using Javascript.

After user adds a tv show, the button is created. Once the tv button is clicked, the GIPHY API will return 10 results.

In order to play the gif, user must click the gif to animate, and click one more time to get the still.
